Serial Data Word Parser 

# Overview
- Implemented a non-overlapping sequence detector state machine 
- Just type 'make'  in WordParserSerial directory and then run binary file named 'WordParser' to execute
- Enter sequence of characters onto terminal (emulating serial port), hit enter
- When 'hello' is found, program displays the same and exits
- Can be modified to find any word by just changing line#13 on main.c

# ToDo
- Modify to make a 'phrase parser'
